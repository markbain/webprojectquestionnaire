#Web Design Project Client Questionnaire#

The more information you can give me at this stage, the better I can use my skills to tailor the design to meet your needs.

So try your best to provide as much info as possible.
Everyone who has a say in the direction of this project should fill out the worksheet. They can do this on their own or in a group.

This form is designed to be completed on a computer, rather than printed, which is why I haven’t left space after each question. Just expand the space to fit your needs.


----------



## About you (& your existing site, if you have one) ##
*Tell me about you/your business*

- What are your goals? (please be as specific as possible!)
	-  ... as a business? 
	- ... for the website? 
- Who are your competitors?
- How are you different?
- What do you think of their web presence? (i.e. website, Facebook page, etc.)
- Which of their ideas would you like to steal?
- Which of their mistakes would you like to avoid?
- When would you realistically like to launch?



## Your existing site ##
*(Please provide me with the URL)*

- Which aspects of your existing site would you like to change? Why?
- Which would you like to keep? Why?
- How do you currently add content to your site?
- Are you happy using this current method?
- How public is your site? Do users have to register to use your site? Are there any member-only functions or areas?
- Do you expect to generate any money from this site? If so, please outline your business model.


## Your users ##

- How do your users find your site?
- What do they do there?
- Why will they come back?
- Who are they?
- How many visitors are you getting right now? 


## Other practical stuff ##



- Outline any ideas for features you’d like to see on your site.
- How do these features support your goal and the goals of your users?
- Do you have a domain name for the site? If so, what is it? If not, any ideas?
- Do you have a web-host? (i.e. GoDaddy, DreamHost, etc.)
- Do you have (for the project):
	- a Twitter account?
	- a Facebook page?
	- other social media accounts?


## Design concept ##

- How do you want your visitors to feel about you/your business?
- Which websites do you like the look of? (Please provide a list of URLs, and some comment which lets me know what you like about each one)
- Do you have any images you would like to include in the design? (i.e. logos, favicons, etc.) 
	- Do you own the rights? (be honest!)
	- Are these images optimised for the web?
	- What formats are the images in? (i.e .jpg, .png, etc.)
- Do you have any strong feelings about colour? Are there any colours which you really don’t want to use? (i.e. colours associated with a competitor)
- Does your business already have a visual identity which needs to be considered in the design? Please supply details (i.e. logos, corporate colour schemes, etc.)
- Any other ideas or information that could help me come up with a design?


## Content ##
 
- What content do you have to put on the site? (i.e. video, downloads, audio, samples, articles, images, events listing, link rolls, product listings, testimonials, case studies, examples of work done, freebies, etc.)
- Is this content available now? If so, how can I access it? 


## Compatibility & accessibility ##

- Does your site need to look identical in all the main browsers? 
(i.e. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.) or would you be happy with some variation? *For the majority of sites, the answer to this question is no. Making sites display identically in every major browser is time-consuming and therefore expensive.*
- Do you need a special version of your site optimised for mobile devices? (i.e. iPhone, iPad, etc.) *All my websites work on mobile devices, but they are designed for far bigger screens. Designing a separate version of the site for mobile costs more.*



## Have I missed anything? ##
*If so, add it below.*
